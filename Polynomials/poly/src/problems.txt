Problem 1: This is a compilation Error. Here the file name is different from that of the class name.
	   Hence, the compiler is not accepting the class. 

Problem 2: This is a compilation Error(Incompatibility Error). In this instance, This occured as the data type of variable 
	   is different from that of the assigned value of the variable.

Problem 3: This is a Runtime Error(Arthemetic Expection error). This has occured due to the denominator in a division is zero,
	   which is considered a wrong operation. 

Problem 4: This is a Compilation error (Identifier expected). When declaring attributes of a method java expects that each attribute
	   to have independent declarations. 

Problem 5: This is a Compilation error (Missing Return Statement). Although else statement following an if is not mandatory the method declared expecting 
           a data to be returned expects a return statement at all times.In this case if y<x there has no return value. Hence, compilation error. 

Problem 6: This is a runtime error.As the array list is dynamic and only allocates the space for initial capacity and doesn't store anything, when we
	   try to retreive the data from array of zero length the runtime error persists. 

Problem 7: This is a Compilation Error (Incompatibility Error). In this instance, This occured as data type char (single quote) is assigned 
	   with String (double quotes). 

Problem 8: This is a Compilation Error (Initialization Error). In this instance, variable j used an assignment value of k before declaration. 

Problem 9: This is a Compilation Error(Incompatibility Error). In this instance, This occured as data type float is assinged with double 
           (0.0 is double while 0.0f is float)value. 

Problem 10: This is a Runtime Error. In this instance, expecting the output from out of bound string.
